## A Finite State Machine Protocol for EVM Blockchains
### What is this?
Fismo is a way of simulating stateful things, processes, or maps of places on EVM blockchains.

There are standards for tokens that allow us to represent things like currency, ownership, and membership. But why do we have no standard for representing a process or map and an individual's path through it?

Each user's position on their journey through a state machine is recorded, and can be publicly queried by anyone. Progress can be controlled by the tokens a user holds. Likewise, tokens could be transferred to a user when they or take some action or arrive at some waypoint.

* ðŸ’¥ Cheaply clone Fismo on Ethereum or deploy to any EVM
* ðŸ’¥ Configure and install a virtually unlimited number of machines
* ðŸ’¥ Deploy custom logic to be triggered by any state transition
* ðŸ’¥ Deploy custom logic for controlling access to your machines
* ðŸ’¥ Use off-chain metadata to describe states in any medium
