# The Finite State Machine Protocol for EVM Blockchains
Fismo Machines are a way of simulating processes, branching narratives, maps of places, or nearly any stateful thing you can imagine.

_Yo dawg, we heard you like machines, so we put this machine in our state machine docs._ It represents your instance of our machine that you will install your machines into. Incidentally, It was created by a machine using [Midjourney](https://twitter.com/midjourney).

- âœ… Initialization and access of machine-specific storage slots
- âœ… Clear and complete interface documentation and inline code comments
- âœ… Separation of concerns into inheritance tree for easy comprehension and maintenance
- âœ… Shared domain model for contract structures, enums, events, & constants
- âœ… Domain model expressed in JS for use in deployment and testing
- âœ… Domain model unit tests
- âœ… Shared Script modules for reuse in both deployment and testing
- âœ… Contract unit tests
- âœ… Working examples
- âœ… Example machine tests (multi-step operation of machine examples)
- âœ… CI build and test with Github Actions
- âœ… Contract interfaces documentation
- âœ… Developer setup and tasks documentation
- âœ… Developer environment configuration template
- âœ… High level architecture documentation
- âœ… Contextually filter actions on guard contracts
- âœ… Allow self-targeting transitions to inspect the action
- âœ… Optimize contract size
